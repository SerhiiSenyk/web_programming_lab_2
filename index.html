            <h2>About group</h2>
            <p>
                The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With a line-up comprising John Lennon, 
                Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they are regarded as the most influential band of all time. 
                The group were integral to the evolution of pop music into an art form and to the development of the counterculture 
                of the 1960s. Their sound, rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, incorporated elements of classical music 
                and traditional pop in innovative ways. They also pioneered recording techniques and explored music styles ranging
                from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As they continued to draw influences from a variety 
                of cultural sources, their musical and lyrical sophistication grew, and they came to be seen as embodying the
                era's socio-cultural movements.

                Led by the band's primary songwriters, Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in 
                Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core 
                trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who had been together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers,
                including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional 
                act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after
                their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed "Beatlemania",
                the band acquired the nickname "the Fab Four", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage
                sometimes given the informal title of "fifth Beatle".

                The Beatles are the best-selling band in history, with estimated sales of over 800 million albums worldwide. They are 
                the best-selling music artists in the US, with certified sales of over 178 million units, and have had more number-one
                albums on the British charts, and have sold more singles in the UK, than any other act. The group were inducted into 
                the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members were inducted individually between 1994 and 2015.
                In 2008, the group topped Billboard magazine's list of the all-time most successful artists; as of 2019, the Beatles 
                hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with twenty. The band have received seven Grammy Awards,
                an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were
                also collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the twentieth century's 100 most influential people.

                Abbey Road is the eleventh studio album by English rock band the Beatles, released on 26 September 1969 by Apple Records.
                The recording sessions were the last in which all four Beatles participated. Let It Be was the final album that the 
                Beatles completed and released before the band's dissolution in April 1970, but most of the album had been recorded 
                before the Abbey Road sessions began. The two-sided hit single from the album, "Something" backed with 
                "Come Together", was released in October and topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States.
